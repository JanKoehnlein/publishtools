# Hercules Compliance


The [smart contract for IT provisioning methodology](smart_contract_for_it) allows for for transparency and autitability of deployed IT workloads.

### VDC Compute compliance

Deployed [ZOS Containers](zos_container) are end to end described in the [blockchain database](bcdb.md) and inspectable.

### VDC Storage compliance

Deployed Hercules [storage solutions]() and kubernetes cluster are end to end described in the [blockchain database](bcdb) and inspectable.


For compliance purposes VDC Storage can be configured to have characteristics like:

- Immutability:  Write Once, Read Many-times (WORM)
- File versioning. Every update to a file leads to a new file version number.  Keep a number of (or all) older versions of the files to have complete traceability of what changed when, where and by whom.
- File activity logging.  Each and ever activity on files can be stored and made auditable to respective governance people, departments or authorities.

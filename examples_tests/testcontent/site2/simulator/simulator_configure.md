# Simulator for the ThreeFold Grid and Token

[webixexample](simulator_configure_webix.html ':include :type=iframe width=100% height=300px frameBorder="0" scrolling="no" align="center"')

- Hardware Choice: ```amd_big``` is the default one and cannot be changed for now
    - this is a box of 4.3k USD which corresponds well to an avg decent server in cloud datacenters.
- Growth: is in nr of nodes which we expect the grid to have in 5 years
    - 1% market share of current internet cloud is about 5-10.000.000 servers.
- Token Price: 
    - you can select a fixed nr, eg. 3 would mean you expect the TFT token price to go to 3 USD over 5 years.
- Unit Price Range: these are the sales prices of the cloud units, this param allows you to choose the avg price range the grid will sell it capacity for ([see here for pricing info about the cloud](cloud_pricing))
    - CU = compute unit, 15 USD is a good price (on market between 20 and 200)
    - SU = storage unit, 10 USD is a good price (on market between 20 and 160)
    - NU = network unit
- The simulator only takes capacity sales into consideration, the TFT will be used for many other use cases but this has not been included in the simulator. The simulator is just a way to visualize the growth of the grid in relation to TFT price and how the TFGrid provides a good economical model for the TF Farmer.


> It's good to compare how the suggested sales prices compare with the market, [see here](cloud_pricing.md)
